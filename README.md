# snake Game
made from canvas and snake is not other than array of objects wich all have locations in the canvas and according to that locations snake moves, if its confusing read the code one time its not that hard
and its a fun project i'd say because we can enjoy after completing the project 

if you want to play go to this link -> [Snake-game](https://divysoni03.github.io/snakeGame/)

- this game now also works on mobile now so all of you can <b>TRY</b>
- i also added the feature to select difficuly so if you are bored playing on same speed you can increase the speed of snake and have fun.
- and i was thinking of adding arrows to control the snake but instead i added the swipe feature so you can control the snake with a swipe
# NOTE : if you are using crome or brave on mobile then down swipe can refresh the page and your score will be GONE so please don't do long swipes on phone
