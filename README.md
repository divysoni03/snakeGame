# snake Game
made from canvas and snake is not other than array of objects wich all have locations in the canvas and according to that locations snake moves, if its confusing read the code one time its not that hard

and its a fun project i'd say because we can enjoy after completing the project 

if you want to play go to this link -> ![Snake-game](https://divysoni03.github.io/snakeGame/)
